# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

It feels good. I just keep spending too much time on certain things.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I'm not taking breaks and I'm staying focused for too long on things that stump me. So not great.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I need reminders to take breaks for sure. I'm going to build those into my calendar. I feel like I've got a lot of the support I need already available.
